AI Email Outreach Agent

An automated, end-to-end AI agent that scrapes websites, summarizes company information, generates personalized cold emails using LLMs, and sends them with human-like delays — all fully hands-free.

Built with Groq, Python, BeautifulSoup, and SMTP, this system is a practical example of applied AI engineering and automation.

🚀 Features
✓ Fully automated outreach pipeline

For each lead, the agent:

Reads lead data from CSV

Scrapes the company's website

Summarizes what the company does using an LLM

Generates a personalized cold email (JSON-formatted)

Sends the email via SMTP

Logs the result with timestamps

Waits a random delay (mimics human behavior)

✓ AI-powered personalization

Uses LLMs (Groq API) to:

Extract meaningful website information

Condense it into a short business summary

Generate a high-quality, multi-paragraph, non-templated email

Enforce strict constraints (formatting, wording, JSON structure)

No two emails are the same.

✓ Human-like behavior

To prevent spam-like patterns:

Randomized delays

Unique wording

Varied sentence structure

Personalized references based on website summary

✓ Modular architecture

The project is fully modularized:

⚙️ How It Works (Flow)

Load Leads
Reads leads.csv → extracts name, email, company, website.

Scrape Website
Downloads HTML → extracts title, meta description, H1 → cleans + truncates.

Summarize Website (LLM)
Converts raw website text into a 1–2 sentence description.

Generate Email (LLM)
Strictly enforced:

100–120 words

2–3 paragraphs

Personalization

Exactly one mention of 3D visuals

No use of “From ” (to avoid Gmail quote formatting)

JSON output only

Send Email via SMTP
Fully automated.

Log Result
Saves:

timestamp

lead info

subject

email body

send status

Random Delay
Waits a human-like number of seconds before the next lead.

📁 CSV Format

Your leads.csv should include:

Name,Company,Email,Website
John Doe,Acme Inc,john@acme.com,https://acme.com
...


Invalid rows are skipped automatically.

🔧 Setup
1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Add your .env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
EMAIL_ADDRESS=hello@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_smtp_app_password

3. Run the agent
python main.py

🔍 Example Output (Console)
================================================================================
Processing: John Doe <john@acme.com> (Acme Inc.)
Subject: Boost Acme’s product visuals with 3D animation

Hi John Doe,

After checking your website, I noticed Acme’s focus on innovative smart-home devices...
...

Sent.

Waiting 42.3 seconds before next lead...
