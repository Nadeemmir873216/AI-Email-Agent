📬 AI Email Outreach Agent

An end-to-end AI-powered outreach system that automatically scrapes websites, summarizes company information, generates personalized cold emails using LLMs, and sends them with human-like timing.

Built using Groq, Python, BeautifulSoup, and SMTP — designed as a clean, modular AI engineering project suitable for professional portfolios and internships.

🚀 Features

Full automation pipeline
Scrapes → summarizes → generates → sends → logs

LLM-powered personalization with strict JSON output

Website scraper using BeautifulSoup

Human-like randomized delays between emails

Modular architecture (easy to extend with LangGraph later)

Real-world SMTP sending (Zoho / Google Workspace)

CSV-based lead ingestion

Logging of all sent emails

🧠 How It Works

Load leads from CSV

Scrape the company’s website

Summarize content using Groq LLM

Generate a personalized, multi-paragraph email

Validate JSON and format the email

Send email via SMTP

Log details to sent_emails.csv

Wait a random delay before processing the next lead
